in: vector<char>& chars
out: int

Approach:

1. Keep a counter: lenString1

2. read the chars till the end,
	- in the above loop, store character in index in data type 'char' and name it c,
	- loop again until the end (n == chars.size()) or when we encounter any other character than c,
	- keep this loop length in count,
	- append to chars

3. pop_back() until the lenString1 end is string
